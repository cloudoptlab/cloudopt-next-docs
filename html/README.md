Cloudopt Next is a very lightweight micro-service framework based on kotlin and vertx for the Next generation. You can handle url parsing, data encapsulation, and Json output. Radically reducing development time and improving development experience. Cloudopt Next absorbed the ideas of [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)，[JFinal](https://github.com/jfinal/jfinal)，[Resty](https://github.com/Dreampie/Resty)，[Vertx](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web) and other excellent projects, and not only had a excellent development experience, but also had a shallow learning curve.


**Cloudopt Next has the following features:**

>**Simple** Minimalist design, almost no configuration, no dependence on tomcat, jetty and other web containers.
>**Asyn** Based on vertx, it is easy to achieve high-performance asynchronous services.
>**Plugin** Supports various components of the vertx system, and also supports the extension of functions through plug-ins. The official also provides a large number of useful plug-ins.
