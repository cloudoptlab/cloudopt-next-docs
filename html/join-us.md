## Sharing experience
In addition to answering questions and sharing resources in chat rooms, there are other ways to share and grow your insights:

Develop learning materials. We often say that the best way to learn is to teach others. If you are doing something interesting with Vue, you can write a blog, organize a seminar, or even create a gist to share on social platforms: these can enhance your specific knowledge.

Focus on (watch) the warehouse you care about, so that whenever there is a new movement in the warehouse, you will be notified immediately, getting fresh information about the ongoing discussions and upcoming new features. This is a great way to accumulate expertise and you will eventually have the ability to solve the problem (issue) and submit a pull request.

Of course, you can also follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) to get the latest information.

## Translate and write documents
You can help improve the Chinese or English documentation and translate it into a language that you are good at. As soon as you have made progress, please open an issue or pull request at the main warehouse.

## Develop plug-ins
Cloudopt Next has a very good plugin system. You can contribute your own plugin for Cloudopt Next. We will also recommend each excellent plugin in the official documentation. If you need a recommendation, open an issue at the main warehouse.
