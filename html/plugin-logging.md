﻿﻿Cloudopt-next-logging is a very useful logging plugin and one of the core components of cloudopt-next. Cloudopt-next-logging supports automatic switching of the JDK's own logs and slf4j. By default, cloudopt-next uses slf4j+logback. It is also recommended that you use the same logging framework.Cloudopt-next-logging also supports automatic output of logs of different colors to the console based on the log level, which you can turn off manually. If you are using the cloudopt-next-web framework, configure it directly in the configuration file.````kotlinColorer.enable = false````````javaColorer.setEnable(false)````We recommend that you use cloudopt-next-logging as your logging tool during development to facilitate unified management. The use of cloudopt-next-logging is almost identical to that of slf4j and log4j.````kotlinprivate val logger = Logger.getLogger(TestCase::class.java)logger.debug("debug")logger.info("info")logger.warn("warn")logger.error("error")````````javaprivate static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(TestCase.class);logger.debug("debug");logger.info("info");logger.warn("warn");logger.error("error");````
