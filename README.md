### Deploying

----

The site is automatically deployed when commits land in master, via Docker.

### On Translations

----

If you feel okay with translating sorta alone, you can fork the repo, create a "work-in-progress" issue to inform others that you're doing the translation, and go for it.

And thank you in advance.
